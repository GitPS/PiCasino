Project Proposal 
=============

#### Company Name: 

###### Team Members: Phillip Sime, Aaron Jensen, Michael Hoyt, Andrew Reis

#### Project Description:

Our project will be a LAN casino based game that you will be able to extend with other games by using the included API.  The main game engine with the logic will be hosted in a server environment running on a Rasberry Pi.  The Raspberry Pi will have Debian Squeeze along with Java SE installed.  The Raspberry Pi will also be connected to a switch that will allow LAN connections.  There will also be a GUI based in Java that can run on any environment that is running Java 1.7 (or higher).  The GUI will allow users to connect via UDP to the game server and interact by utilizing the Java networking classes.  The GUI will not handle any of the game logic.  All of the logic will be sent/received to/from the game server on the Raspberry Pi for handeling.  

All of the members in our group are very knowledgeable in the Java programming language.  Aaron and Michael have experience building GUIs in Java, Phil has experience in Java networking, and Andrew and Phil both have experience with Linux based OSes.
